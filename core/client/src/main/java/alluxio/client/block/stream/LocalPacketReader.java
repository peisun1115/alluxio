/**
 * A block reader that streams a block region from a netty data server.
 *
 * Protocol:
 * 1. The client sends a read request (blockId, offset, length).
 * 2. Once the server receives the request, it streams packets the client. The streaming pauses
 *    if the server's buffer is full and resumes if the buffer is not full.
 * 3. The client reads packets from the stream. Reading pauses if the client buffer is full and
 *    resumes if the buffer is not full. If the client can keep up with network speed, the buffer
 *    should have at most one packet.
 * 4. The client stops reading if it receives an empty packe which signifies the end of the block
 *    streaming.
 * 5. The client can cancel the read request at anytime. The cancel request is ignored by the
 *    server if everything has been sent to channel.
 * 6. In order to reuse the channel, the client must read all the packets in the channel before
 *    releasing the channel to the channel pool.
 * 7. To make it simple to handle errors, the channel is closed if any error occurs.
